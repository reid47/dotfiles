# my dotfiles

Assorted configuration files for various things. A constant work-in-progress.

These are only known to work on Mac OS X and with the tools listed below.

Some tools that are configured here:
- Neovim (for editing code)
- iTerm2 (terminal)
- Tmux (for managing sessions/windows)
- Fish shell (for all shell stuff)
- Homebrew (to install dependencies)
